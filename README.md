## QFVCS: Quantum Fractal Visualization & Computation System

QFVCS bridges quantum physics simulation and neural network optimization through Schrödinger-like evolution of ternary-weight networks (e.g., BitNet b1.58). It leverages wave function dynamics to drive training in a physically inspired way.

## Highlights

- Neural weights mapped to qutrit amplitudes: {-1, 0, +1}
- Schrödinger-based optimization: Time-dependent evolution
- Modular architecture: Schrödinger engine, fractal math, dynamic visual tracking
- BitNet ternary logic: Low-bit hardware compatible
- Designed for visualization, experimentation, and research

## Documentation

- Full overview: [`index.html`](https://qfvcs.vercel.app/)
- Exportable as PDF via browser
- Additional references in `/docs` and `/papers` folders (if available)
